See the mock crowdfunding in action [here](https://stackblitz.com/edit/crowdsourcing?file=src%2FApp.vue)

## Technical Stuff
### Oranisation
* We have an Angular project on Codesandbox (the map), and a Vue project on Stackblitz (a simulated crodwfunding platform). We couldnt't decide between Angular and Vue so we did both. V2 will be in React :P
* [Map](https://codesandbox.io/s/eager-proskuriakova-jlvd5)
* [Crowdfunding]()
* This repo is the entry point we are using the _issuses_ here.

### System design (crowdfunding integrator / mashup pattern)
* The map serves as an index for location-based crowdfunding campaigns
